Ludum Dare #33: You are the monster

I am going to try create a small turn based combat system... 
If all works out it should be similar to Darkest Dungeon or something like that.

The premise is that you are a monster, in this game you are a fresh demon, and you have made it your mission to overthrow the devil, Satan, and become the new King of Hell. You do this by battling his minion's as well as his lieutnants, until you reach and claim the throne!
